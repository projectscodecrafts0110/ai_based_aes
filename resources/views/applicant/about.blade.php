                            The AI-Based Applicant Evaluation System (AES) of ISPSC is a web-based platform developed to
                            streamline and enhance the recruitment and evaluation process for prospective applicants. By
                            digitizing the application workflow, AES eliminates traditional manual processes, ensuring
                            efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in managing applicant data.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">
                            Applicants can create personal accounts, complete their application forms, and upload all
                            required
                            documents online. The system securely stores and organizes each applicant’s information in a
                            centralized database, allowing HR personnel to easily access, monitor, and manage submissions.
                            This
                            centralization not only improves data integrity but also simplifies reporting and auditing
                            processes.

                        <p class="text-muted">
                            AES leverages advanced AI algorithms, specifically K-Means clustering and Decision Tree
                            analysis, to
                            analyze and rank applicants based on predefined criteria and qualifications. K-Means groups
                            applicants with similar skills and experiences, while Decision Trees evaluate individual
                            profiles to
                            determine suitability for the available positions. This AI-assisted evaluation reduces human
                            error,
                            ensures objective assessments, and provides HR staff with actionable insights for informed
                            decision-making.

                            Overall, AES enhances the recruitment process by improving speed, reliability, and fairness.
                            Applicants benefit from a smoother and more transparent experience, while the institution gains
                            a
                            structured, efficient system that optimizes HR operations and supports data-driven hiring
